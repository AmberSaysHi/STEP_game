
# Trying to do user input
Name = input("Enter your name")
# It's that simple lol. In java it was so much harder. Note that you can only enter strings
print("Hello " + Name)

num = input("pick a random number")
print (Name + num)
# This works, they are not different data types, the input thingy will take the input no matter what it is and convert it to a string.
# Also, if something is not working, make sure you spelled "input" like "input" and not like something else.

ActualNum = 69
#print(ActualNum + Name)
# See look, that didn't work because you put two different data types in one print statement.
